## Overview 📚

💡 Tired of your factories looking a bit... meh? Want to turn your industrial empire into a visual masterpiece? Well, you're in luck! This is your ticket to transforming Satisfactory from "Oh, that's nice" to "Holy, is this even the same game?!"

🔥 **Taj's Graphical Overhaul** is a graphical enhancement mod for *Satisfactory* that significantly improves visual quality and performance. By utilizing techniques like lighting tweaks and shadow enhancements, the mod optimizes reflections and overall visual fidelity without compromising performance. The mod incorporates the latest Unreal Engine 5 technologies, including Lumen, which provide advanced global illumination.&#x20;

🎯 This mod empowers players with both high-end and low-end setups to tailor the game's graphics to their preferences. By offering customizable options for advanced features, such as shadowing, light system or global illumination settings, the mod enables users to prioritize either visual quality or performance based on their system capabilities and preferences.&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;

🤯 From simple slider adjustments to full-on ray tracing wizardry (hardware raytracing not included, yetTM). There's always something here to make your conveyor belts shine and your nuclear plants glow (safely, I hope...). Get ready to see every pipe, every constructor, and every majestic alien creature in eye-popping detail. Let's crank up those graphics and make efficiency look sexy!&#x20;

> ###### ⚠️ **Warning: Side effects may include excessive screenshot taking and the sudden urge to redesign your entire factory for optimal photo ops. Get ready to reimagine your builds!**
